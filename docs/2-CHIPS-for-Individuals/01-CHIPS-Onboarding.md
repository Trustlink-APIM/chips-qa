# CHIPSÂ® Onboarding of Individuals

![CHIPS Onboarding Sequence Diagram](https://marketplace.trustlinkhosting.com/images/Providers/CHIPS/Onboarding-SequenceDiagram.png)

Onboarding of individuals into CHIPS&reg; follows the sequence diagram as above. 

# Requirements 
In order to integrate securely to the CHIPS&reg; Payment Platform via the [Trustlink API Marketplace] there should be a backend system that issues the APIs through to the API Gateway in the Marketplace.

You can start to test with the Storefront APIs below (See [How it works](../06-how-it-works.md)). Before [signing up](https://marketplace.trustlinkhosting.com/component/apiportal/registration) for Sandbox access on the [Trustlink API Markteplace].

# Flow
## User sign up 
Once the user indicates that they want to sign up for a CHIPS&reg; profile and account a check is done to see is the mobile number has been registered before or not.
